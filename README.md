Said To Gemini
A Bytebeat composer is a music-making tool that uses a short,
single-line program or formula to generate music
algorithmically. Instead of using traditional instruments or
scores, it creates audio by treating the program as a
function of time, turning the code's output into a series of
numbers that are then played as sound.
